    part4.plot_felony_rearrest_catplot(pred_universe)

    print("In the second plot, the model still assigns higher risks to those with felony charges even when predicting nonfelony rearrests, though the difference isn't as drastic. This might indicate the model's overall bias towards associating higher risk with more severe charges.")

    # 3. Generate a categorical plot for felony rearrest prediction with hue
    part4.plot_felony_rearrest_with_hue(pred_universe)
    print("The third plot, with hues showing actual rearrests, reveals that even those who weren't rearrested for a felony still had a higher predicted probability if they were originally charged with a felony. This suggests the model might overestimate risk based on initial charges, potentially leading to biased predictions.")

    # Answer the question about prediction probabilities
    print("The model predicting higher risks for people with a felony charge who didn't reoffend, compared to those with a misdemeanor who did, shows a possible bias. It suggests the model may be putting too much weight on the severity of the initial charge rather than the actual likelihood of reoffending.")

    # 3. Generate scatter plot for prediction for felony vs prediction for nonfelony but it's hued by actual felony rearrest
    part5.scatter_felony_vs_nonfelony_hue_rearrest(pred_universe)
    print("The model seems biased, giving higher risk predictions to those with felony charges who didnâ€™t reoffend, while underestimating those with misdemeanors who did.")
    print("This suggests the model might be focusing too much on the severity of the initial charge instead of the actual likelihood of reoffending.")
